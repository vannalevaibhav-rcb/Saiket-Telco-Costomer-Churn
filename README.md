## Introduction

Welcome to the Telco Customer Churn Prediction project. This project is dedicated to predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry, a vital task for businesses aiming to retain their customers and make data-driven decisions to reduce attrition rates.


## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Churn Prediction**: Develop accurate machine learning models that can predict which customers are likely to churn. By identifying at-risk customers early, companies can take proactive measures to retain them.

2. **Data Analysis**: Conduct in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into customer behavior, demographics, and the factors influencing churn. EDA helps in understanding the dataset and uncovering actionable patterns.

3. **Model Building**: Utilize various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and LightGBM, to build predictive models. These models will help classify customers as potential churners or non-churners.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models using relevant metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation provides an understanding of how well the models perform in practice.

5. **Recommendations**: Provide actionable recommendations and insights based on the analysis and model outcomes. These recommendations can guide business strategies to reduce churn rates.
### Data Preprocessing

To prepare the data for analysis, we undertook the following steps:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Identified and addressed missing values to ensure data integrity.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Categorical variables such as 'gender,' 'contract type,' and 'payment method' were encoded into numerical values for model compatibility.
- **Scaling Numerical Features**: Numerical features were scaled to maintain a consistent range, thereby improving model performance.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, we uncovered key insights, including:

- **Summary Statistics**: Computed basic statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical variables.
- **Data Visualizations**: Created various visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices to better understand data distribution and relationships.
- **Churn Analysis**: Analyzed churn rates in relation to different customer attributes to identify potential patterns and trends.

## Model Building

We employed several machine learning models for churn prediction, including:

- **Logistic Regression**: A fundamental classification model used for predicting churn status.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Employed for modeling more complex decision boundaries.
- **LightGBM Classifier**: A gradient boosting model known for its efficiency and predictive power.

Hyperparameters and model configurations were fine-tuned to achieve the best performance.

## Model Evaluation

To assess model performance, we employed various metrics including:

- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall accuracy of the models in predicting churn.
- **Precision**: Evaluates the models' ability to correctly predict positive churn cases.
- **Recall**: Assesses the models' ability to capture all actual positive churn cases.
- **F1-Score**: A combination of precision and recall to measure the model's overall performance.
- **Confusion Matrices**: Visualizations of model predictions versus actual churn status.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Telco Customer Churn Prediction project successfully explored, preprocessed, and built predictive models to identify customers at risk of churning. Key findings and feature importance were discussed, providing valuable insights for the business to take targeted actions to reduce churn rates. Further enhancements and model improvements can be considered for future work.
